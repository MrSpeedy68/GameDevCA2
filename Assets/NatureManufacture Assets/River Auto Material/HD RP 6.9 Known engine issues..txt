In unity 2019.2 HD RP there is exposure issue inside engine. In normal scenes it shoudnt exist but in unity sample scene it is. In fact that killed shore and distortion.
It's raported bug and we wait for fix. At our and new scenes it work fine. Its possible to fx that. In all water shaders change:
line: GetInverseCurrentExposureMultiplier()*0.001 change into line: GetInverseCurrentExposureMultiplier() but this can generate brightness issues.
